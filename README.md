## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React 19
  - TypeScript 4.9+
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
  - React Context API for state management

- **Backend**: 
  - Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
  - PostgreSQL database with JSON support
  - Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

- **Deployment**:
  - AWS S3 static website hosting
  - CloudFront CDN for global distribution
  - SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager
  - Custom domain: runcount.rbios.net
  - Automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure Overview

- **S3 Bucket**: `runcountapp` (us-east-1)
- **CloudFront Distribution**: `E3FN1GEXG15HYW`
- **Custom Domain**: `runcount.rbios.net`
- **SSL Certificate**: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- **DNS**: Route53 hosted zone for rbios.net

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

The application uses automated deployment via GitHub Actions with the following workflow:

1. **Test Phase**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run test suite with coverage
   - Build production bundle

2. **Deploy Phase** (main branch only):
   - Deploy build files to S3
   - Configure S3 bucket for static website hosting
   - Invalidate CloudFront cache for immediate updates

3. **Notification Phase**:
   - Display deployment summary with URLs and status

### Manual Deployment

You can trigger deployment manually:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run deploy.yml

# Or via legacy script (if AWS CLI configured locally)
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Infrastructure Setup

For setting up your own deployment:

1. **S3 Bucket**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name
   aws s3 website s3://your-bucket-name --index-document index.html --error-document index.html
   ```

2. **CloudFront Distribution**:
   - Use provided `scripts/cloudfront-distribution-config.json` as template
   - Update domain names and certificate ARN
   - Create distribution: `aws cloudfront create-distribution --distribution-config file://config.json`

3. **SSL Certificate**:
   ```bash
   aws acm request-certificate --domain-name your-domain.com --validation-method DNS --region us-east-1
   ```

4. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to repository secrets
   - Update `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
